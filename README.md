# ESP-IDF Projects with PlatformIO

Welcome to the ESP-IDF Projects repository. This collection features various projects developed with the ESP32 microcontroller using PlatformIO and the ESP-IDF framework. Each project is designed to showcase different capabilities and use cases of the ESP32, providing a practical foundation for learning and development.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Blink Code with PlatformIO**
A fundamental project that demonstrates the basic operation of the ESP32 by blinking an LED connected to a GPIO pin. This simple yet effective project serves as an introductory exercise for setting up an ESP32 project with PlatformIO and understanding the core structure of an ESP-IDF application.

**Key Features:**
- Basic GPIO control for LED blinking.
- Introduction to ESP-IDF and PlatformIO project setup.
- Essential for beginners to understand microcontroller programming.

### 2. **Temperature and Humidity Display with DHT11**
This project interfaces with a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. The collected data is then displayed on an OLED screen, providing real-time environmental monitoring. This project demonstrates sensor integration and I2C communication with peripherals.

**Key Features:**
- Sensor data acquisition from the DHT11 sensor.
- Displaying data on an OLED screen via I2C.
- Real-time data updates and sensor interaction.

### 3. **ESP32 HTTP Server with WiFi Connection and Dynamic IP Display**
Set up an HTTP server on the ESP32 to serve a web page displaying the deviceâ€™s dynamically assigned IP address. This project involves establishing a WiFi connection, setting up an HTTP server, and handling network-related tasks. The project also outputs the IP address to the serial monitor for easy access.

**Key Features:**
- Establishing a WiFi connection and handling IP assignments.
- Setting up an HTTP server to serve dynamic content.
- Serial monitoring of network details and web server operations.

### 4. **Control LED via Web Server on ESP32**
This project enables control of an LED through a web server hosted on the ESP32. By connecting the ESP32 to a WiFi network, users can interact with a web interface to toggle the LED state. This project highlights web server setup, HTTP request handling, and real-time hardware control via a browser.

**Key Features:**
- Web server implementation for remote hardware control.
- Handling HTTP GET and POST requests for LED operations.
- Interactive web interface for real-time control.

### 5. **ESP32 Web Server for Real-time Temperature and Humidity Data Display**
Build a web server on the ESP32 that continuously reads and displays temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor. The web page, served by the ESP32, updates in real-time, providing users with live environmental data. This project showcases data streaming and web-based visualization.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data acquisition and display using a web server.
- Integration with the DHT11 sensor for environmental monitoring.
- Dynamic content updates using JavaScript for live data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **PlatformIO IDE**: For managing and building the projects.
- **ESP-IDF Framework**: Required for ESP32 development.
- **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with C programming and microcontroller concepts is beneficial.

### Setting Up
1. Open the project in PlatformIO IDE.
2. Navigate to the project folder of interest.
3. Build and upload the code to your ESP32 board using PlatformIO.

### Running the Projects
